# 🌱 AI-Powered Crop Diversification Advisor  

An **AI-driven, farmer-friendly solution** that balances **profitability, soil sustainability, and community intelligence** to recommend the best crop portfolio for farmers.  

---

## ✅ Problem Statement  
Farmers often face challenges in choosing crops due to **uncertain markets, soil degradation, and climate risks**.  
Current advisory systems are either profit-only or too complex.  

---

## ⚙️ Solution Overview  
- **Dual-Model Approach**  
  - **Model A – Profitability**: Suggests top 5 crops based on soil, land, water, and financial goals.  
  - **Model B – Soil Sustainability**: Provides soil health risk scores using rules + decision trees.  
  - **Final Output** → Balanced recommendation combining profit & long-term soil health.  

- **Farmer Network Intelligence**  
  - Learns from farmer success in similar regions (collaborative filtering).  
  - Improves recommendations over time → “farmers learning from farmers.”  

- **Key Features**  
  - **Crop Diversification Score (0–100)** → simple metric for balanced decision-making.  
  - **Financial Goal Alignment** → short-term cash crops vs long-term resilience.  
  - **Offline-First Mobile App** → lightweight ML models (ONNX/TFLite).

## 📐 Architecture Flow  
1. Farmer enters inputs (soil, land size, water, financial goals).  
2. **Model A** → profitability ranking.  
3. **Model B** → soil sustainability check.  
4. Combine into **Crop Diversification Score**.  
5. Farmer network intelligence adjusts based on peer success.  
6. Final recommendation → farmer sees *what* + *why*.

## 📊 Tech Stack  
- **ML Models** → Scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM, Decision Trees, Rule-based engine.  
- **Recommendation Engine** → Collaborative filtering (Surprise / KNN).  
- **Backend** → FastAPI / Django (REST APIs).  
- **Database** → PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (for time-series/weather).  
- **Frontend** → React / React Native (multilingual, offline cache).  
- **Deployment** → Docker, MLflow, ONNX runtime.  

---

## 🚀 Scalability  
- **Microservices** → independent scaling of models & services with Kubernetes.  
- **Data Pipelines** → feature store + batch & real-time data ingestion.  
- **Adaptable Models** → transfer learning for new regions/crops.  
- **Lightweight Inference** → optimized for low-end farmer devices.  
- **Feedback Loop** → farmer adoption data → incremental retraining.  

---

## ⚠️ Implementation Challenges  
- **Data availability & quality** → fragmented soil/crop datasets, farmer-reported bias.  
- **Adoption & trust** → requires explainability & peer validation.  
- **Connectivity issues** → must work reliably offline with sync.  
- **Model maintenance** → continuous retraining & drift detection.

## 🌟 Impact  
- **Higher incomes** today through profit-aligned crops.  
- **Healthier soils** for tomorrow with sustainable practices.  
- **Stronger farming communities** through shared knowledge.  

👉 **In short: More income today, healthier soil tomorrow, resilient farmers forever.**
